You will have 8 seconds to type in the correct word, and when that time is up the computer will automatically move on to the next trial (so you do not need to press the Enter key).</p> <p>After the Recall period, you will study the list of word pairs again in another Study period, and then recall the word pairs again in another Recall period, and so on (Study-Recall-Study-Recall-Study-Recall... etc.). You will continue studying and recalling the word pairs until you have recalled all 24 word pairs one time.
