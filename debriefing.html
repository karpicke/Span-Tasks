                    <dt> 1. What is the general aim of this research? </dt>
                    <dd>The experiment you participated in today is part of a larger study investigating strategies that
                      enhance memory. One strategy examined in this research is known as retrieval practice, which is the finding
                      that practicing retrieval of knowledge can promote learning often to a greater extent than the opportunity
                      for additional study. We are interested in whether your memory will be better for materials over which you
                      were tested versus material for which you studied.</dd>

                    <dt>2. Is this correlational or experimental research?</dt>
                    <dd>The study you participated in represents experimental research. The independent variable we manipulated was
                      the study technique you engaged in (e.g., repeated studying vs. repeated retrieval), and the dependent variable
                      we are interested in is your performance on a final test. We predict that practicing repeated retrieval
                      will produce better retention than repeated studying.</dd>

                    <dt>3. What topic in introductory psychology does this research illustrate?</dt>
                    <dd>The current research falls within the general area of human learning and memory. For an overview of
                      research on human memory, see Chapter 8 in Nairne’s <i>Psychology: The Adaptive Mind (4th Edition)</i>,
                      Chapter 9 in Meyers’ <i>Psychology (8th Edition)</i>, or Chapter 9 in Gray’s <i>Psychology (5th Edition)</i>.
                      Another excellent book covering current research on human memory is <i>The Seven Sins of Memory</i>, by Dan
                      Schacter.</dd>

                    <dt>4. Where can I learn more about this type of research?</dt>
                    <dd>If you are interested in learning more about retrieval practice, here are two relevant references:
                        <dd>

                                  to long-term retention. <i>Journal of Memory and Language</i>, 57, 151-162.</li>

                            </ul>
                    </dl>

                    <dt>5. Who is conducting this research?</dt>
                    <dd>Dr. Jeffrey Karpicke, a professor in cognitive psychology, is supervising this research. You may reach him
                      at 494-0273, via email at karpicke@purdue.edu, or in room PSYC 3156.</dd>

                    <dt>6. How long has the investigator been studying this specific topic and how does this experiment fit
                      into the investigator's program of research?</dt>
                    <dd>Dr. Karpicke began investigating human learning and memory over 15 years ago. The current experiments are
                      designed to examine other ways that basic research on learning and memory can be applied to enhance educational
                      practice.</dd>

                    <dd><i>A lot of research in psychology depends on the participation of individuals like you. We are
                        very grateful for your help. Thank you very much for participating.</i></dd>
